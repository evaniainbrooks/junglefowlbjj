<p>
  It can be a bit tricky to find us the first time. We are in the basement of the Canada Post building at 86 Main Street,
  in downtown Sackville, NB. The entrance is located at the back of the building.
</p>

<p>
  If you follow around the right of the building, through the public parking lot,
  you'll find the door just down the steps and to your left.

  If the door is not open, just ring our buzzer and someone will let you in.
</p>
<p>
  Don't hesitate to contact us if you can't find it.
