<p>From humble beginnings, our journey started in Port Elgin, New Brunswick just before the pandemic. Over the years we grew our programs, honed our skills,
  and it became apparent that the next evolution would be to relocate the gym to serve a larger client base. </p>

<p>We are proud to announce that our newly renovated (February 2023) training facility is located at <span class="font-weight-bold">86 Main Street in downtown Sackville, New Brunswick.</span>
  <a href="#location-card" class="text-info font-weight-bold">The entrance to the basement facility can be found to the left of the building, in the back. Just follow the signs.</a></p>

<p>The main gym facility consists of a <span class="font-weight-bold">1500 square foot matted area</span>, outfitted with brand new tatami mats, perfect for any kind of martial arts training.
  This area is lined with wall mats and a half cage, creating a realistic MMA training experience. Heavy bags, banana bags and other striking equipment can also be found along the perimeter.</p>

<p>Next to the main training area, on other side of the cage is our <span class="font-weight-bold">strength and conditioning area</span>, outfitted with all of the equipment one would expect to find in a CrossFit or weightlifting gym.</p>

<p>Finally, we have an area dedicated to the children. Here we have a <span class="font-weight-bold">large play structure with slides, climbing ropes</span>, and other equipment geared towards the little ones.</p>

<p>We pride ourselves on providing a clean, safe, family friendly training environment. Our primary goal is to promote a healthy lifestyle, and have fun!
